SIMFORIA OPENWIRE BOUNDARY PROOF (v2)

Project: Simforia OpenWire OSINT Ops
Domain: simforia.com
Repository: github.com/simforia/openwire-boundary-proof

This statement anchors the operational identity, authorship continuity,
and hardened instruction integrity of the Simforia OpenWire OSINT
simulation framework.

This proof establishes continuity between prior Simforia boundary
verification artifacts and the OpenWire GPT release state, including
instruction hardening, simulation containment, and authorship identity.

This document is intentionally minimal and serves only as a
cryptographic provenance marker rather than a disclosure of design,
architecture, or operational methodology.
